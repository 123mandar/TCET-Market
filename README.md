Payment System
The TCET Marketplace integrates individual payments using Razorpay or other payment gateways:

A buyer initiates the payment flow.
The backend generates an order and sends it to the payment gateway.
On successful payment, Razorpay sends a callback to verify the transaction.
The backend updates the order status.
Example Workflow:

Payment Status: Pending → Paid → Confirmed.
Email Notifications
Nodemailer is used to send automated emails:
Order Confirmation Emails
Payment Receipts
Status Updates
